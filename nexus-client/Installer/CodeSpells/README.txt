Hi!

This is the launcher for the world I made for you, so we can finally speak without the Nexus listening in!

Just double-click the CodeSpells.exe file in this directory.  The first time you do so, my code will download the latest version of the world and put it in a directory called Versions/.  If I ever make updates to the world, my code will find the updates and download them for you.  (You're welcome!)

Note that the first time you lauch, it may take a few minutes.  Subsequent times will be much faster because the world will already be downloaded. 

Your Friend,
Socky
