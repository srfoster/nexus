			<p>The words, terminal, console, shell, and command line, are closely related ideas. For those interested in the precise definitions, see <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-terminal-console-shell-and-command-line/">this article</a>.</p>
			<p>Our philosophy here is that the precise definitions are less important than the big idea: one powerful kind of interface is one in which a person types commands, and the computer runs them. This interface has been a way that programmers talk to computers since the earliest days of computer science. Modern programmers still use them today.</p>
			<p>The simple terminal in the puzzle above understands just a few commands, but the reality is every terminal is different and most terminals that come with modern operating systems understand MANY more commands.</p>
			<p>The basic anatomy of a command though is often the same: <tt>command arg1 arg2 arg3 ...</tt>. That is, there is a command, followed by 0 or more arguments.</p>

				<li><strong>Exploring Your Terminal</strong>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Easy</strong> Can you figure out how to open the terminal on your computer?</li>	
						<li><strong>Medium</strong> Does the <tt>help</tt> command work? Can you find a command that takes one or more arguments?</li>	
						<li><strong>Hard</strong> Theoretically, you can do anything from the terminal that you could do from your graphical user interface. Can you figure out how to launch a web browser? Can you create a new file? Can you create a folder? Can you navigate your file system? Can you remove contents of a folder? (Hint: The <tt>help</tt> command is used as a reference for experts, not necessarily as a learning resource for terminal novices. You may have to research these things online.) &#129409;</li>
