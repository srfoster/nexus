SOCK PUPPET
Possible Backstory: A powerfull Wizard accidentally enchanted a sock while doing their laundry, and the sock became sentient, and decided to set out into the world. But the real world was harsh, and the sock couldn't make it without getting a job, and after many rejected applications the nexus responed with an entry-level position as a teacher.

 Imagine if the sock puppet starts getting paranoid and starts realizing he can't remember his life before getting a job at the nexus

NEXUS DEVS + COMMUNITY CREATORS
Possibly crazy, eccentric

NEXUS
Makes user question whether it's good or evil. Ends up being good?

 I feel like this game's take on the Nexus is like trying to be kind of a cross of Portal's GLadOS and satire on big companies

Random ideas:
* Sock puppet tells fictional story
  - Mind painters -- a planet where people can create UI at will...
